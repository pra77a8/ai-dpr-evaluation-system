## 📋 Best Practices for Effective Interaction

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "Tell me about risks," ask "What is the cost overrun risk score?"

2. **Ask Follow-up Questions**: 
   - "What is the biggest risk?"
   - "Why is that the biggest risk?"
   - "How can we mitigate that risk?"

3. **Request Actionable Insights**:
   - "What should we do about the schedule delay risk?"
   - "Give me three specific recommendations"

4. **Compare and Contrast**:
   - "How does the environmental risk compare to the resource risk?"
   - "Which recommendations have the highest priority?"

5. **Request Visualizations**:
   - "Show me a chart of the risk distribution"
   - "Create a timeline visualization"

## 🚨 Emergency Response Prompts
